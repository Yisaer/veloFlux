# Pipeline Lifecycle Semantics

## Background

Pipelines in veloFlux are both stored metadata and runtime objects.

The manager persists the pipeline spec and desired state in storage, and execution happens inside
a specific flow instance.

## Goals

- Define the stable pipeline resource model across storage and runtime.
- Clarify create, upsert, start, stop, and delete semantics.
- Explain how desired-state persistence interacts with runtime success or failure.

## Non-Goals

- SQL planning internals.
- Sink-specific connector behavior.
- Full REST endpoint reference.

## Pipeline Resource Model

A pipeline resource consists of:

- stored pipeline spec
- target `flow_instance_id`
- stored desired state (`running` or `stopped`)
- runtime installation inside the selected flow instance

The stored spec is the source of truth.

## Create Semantics

Create behavior:

1. canonicalize and validate the target `flow_instance_id`
2. validate pipeline request shape
3. acquire per-pipeline and shared-MQTT operation guards
4. persist the pipeline spec into storage
5. apply the pipeline to the runtime
6. runtime create failure triggers storage rollback

## Upsert Semantics

Upsert keeps the existing pipeline identity and flow-instance binding.

Current rules:

- if a stored pipeline exists, its `flow_instance_id` is reused
- the new request must still pass normal create validation
- previous desired state is read from storage before replacement

Upsert behavior:

- explain the new definition before deleting the old runtime
- delete old runtime and storage record
- persist the new spec
- create the new runtime
- if previous desired state was `running`, persist `running` again and best-effort restart

Upsert is therefore replace-in-place for metadata, but restart after replacement is best effort
rather than transactional.

## Start Semantics

Starting a pipeline first persists desired state as `running`, then asks the runtime to converge.

Behavior:

- `start_pipeline` is idempotent when the runtime is already running
- if no runtime graph is currently materialized, flow lazily builds it from the stored definition
- start failure rolls stored desired state back to `stopped`

## Stop Semantics

Stopping a pipeline first persists desired state as `stopped`, then asks the runtime to stop.

Supported stop modes at the manager surface are:

- `quick` (default)
- `graceful`

Behavior:

- stop is idempotent for already stopped pipelines
- flow marks status `stopped` and drops the runtime pipeline object
- a running pipeline is closed using the requested stop mode and timeout

## Delete Semantics

Delete is storage-authoritative with best-effort runtime cleanup.

Current behavior:

- load the stored pipeline first
- derive the flow-instance binding from stored metadata when possible
- try to delete the runtime copy
- ignore runtime cleanup failures after logging
- delete the stored pipeline record

For running pipelines, delete performs a quick close with a 5-second timeout.

The important invariant is that delete removes manager-owned metadata even if runtime cleanup is
imperfect. This avoids undeletable control-plane objects caused by stale runtime state.

## Desired State Persistence

Desired state is a separate stored record, not just a mirror of runtime status.

Why this matters:

- startup hydration needs a durable desired-state input
- create and upsert can succeed for storage while runtime application is incomplete
- list/status views may need to compare stored intent with current runtime state

Current persistence behavior:

- create does not automatically create a `running` desired state
- start writes `running` before runtime converge
- stop writes `stopped` before runtime converge
- upsert preserves the previous desired state when possible

## Failure And Rollback Semantics

Important failure behaviors:

- create failure rolls back storage
- upsert validates before removing the old runtime, reducing destructive failures
- restart after upsert is best effort; a failed restart leaves desired state downgraded to
  `stopped`
- delete does not roll back metadata when runtime cleanup fails

These are deliberate tradeoffs between control-plane durability and synchronous runtime parity.

## Testing Guidance

- Verify create rollback for pipelines when runtime creation fails after storage persistence.
- Verify upsert preserves `flow_instance_id` and previous desired state.
- Verify running pipelines are best-effort restarted after upsert and downgrade to stopped when
  restart fails.
- Verify stop persists desired state before runtime stop.
- Verify delete removes storage even when runtime cleanup reports an error.
