# Memory Sink

The **Memory sink** publishes pipeline outputs into an in-process pub/sub topic. It is intended
for process-local integration and testing scenarios (no network I/O).

## Overview

- Backing transport: in-process `tokio::sync::broadcast` channels (per topic).
- Topics are **strongly typed**: a topic is either `bytes` or `collection` (mixing is rejected).
- Topics must be **predeclared** via the manager API before a pipeline can publish to them.
- Publishing when there are no subscribers is treated as success (delivered count is `0`).

## Topic Declaration (Manager)

Declare the topic before creating a pipeline that uses a memory sink:

- `POST /memory/topics`

```json
{
  "topic": "demo_bytes",
  "kind": "bytes",
  "capacity": 1024
}
```

Notes:

- `capacity` defaults to `1024` when omitted.
- Declaring an existing topic with a different `kind`/`capacity` is rejected.

## Sink Configuration (Manager)

Add a sink of type `memory` to a pipeline:

| Property | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Yes | - | Must be `memory`. |
| `props.topic` | string | Yes | - | Topic name to publish to (must be declared). |
| `encoder.type` | string | No | `json` | Encoder kind. `none` means the sink publishes `Collection` directly. |

## Data Semantics

The sink uses `encoder.type` to decide which topic kind it publishes:

- `encoder.type != "none"`:
  - The pipeline inserts an encoder before the sink.
  - The sink publishes **bytes** to a `bytes` topic.
- `encoder.type == "none"`:
  - The physical plan does not insert an encoder.
  - The sink publishes **Collection** to a `collection` topic.

The manager validates that the topic exists and that its declared kind matches the encoder mode.

## Collection Materialization (encoder.type = "none")

When publishing to a `collection` topic, the physical plan inserts a dedicated node
`PhysicalMemoryCollectionMaterialize` right before the sink. This node reshapes each input row
(`Tuple`) into a stable layout, so downstream pipelines can rely on a consistent column name + order.

Behavior:

- The output row is rewritten to **1 Message + 0 affiliate**:
  - Message `source` is left empty (`""`). Downstream memory sources normalize the source name to
    the stream binding (SQL datasource name).
  - Message column **names and order** follow the pipeline's planned output schema (the `SELECT`
    field order after wildcard expansion and aliasing).
- The sink does **not** evaluate expressions. It only copies values already materialized by
  upstream processors:
  - `ColumnRef::ByIndex` outputs (including `a AS x`) are fetched from upstream messages by name.
  - Derived columns (for example `a + 1 AS x`) are fetched from affiliate columns.
- Missing columns:
  - If a required column is not found in either messages or affiliate, the sink fills `NULL` and
    logs a warning (once per publish call with the missing column list).
- Duplicate output column names are rejected at planning time for `collection` topics.

Implementation note:

- For performance, `PhysicalMemoryCollectionMaterialize` resolves column getters once using the first
  observed tuple layout and then reads values by index for subsequent rows. Columns that cannot be
  resolved are treated as permanently missing for that processor instance.

## Drop / Lag Behavior (Subscribers)

The implementation uses a bounded broadcast buffer (`capacity`). If subscribers cannot keep up,
they will observe lag and messages may be dropped on the subscriber side. The sink itself does not
block on subscribers.

## Example (Publish Bytes)

```json
POST /pipelines
{
  "id": "pipe_mem_bytes",
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM mem_bytes_stream",
  "sinks": [
    {
      "id": "mem_sink",
      "type": "memory",
      "props": { "topic": "demo_bytes" },
      "encoder": { "type": "json", "props": {} }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example (Publish Collections)

```json
POST /pipelines
{
  "id": "pipe_mem_collection",
  "sql": "SELECT * FROM mem_collection_stream",
  "sinks": [
    {
      "id": "mem_sink",
      "type": "memory",
      "props": { "topic": "demo_collection" },
      "encoder": { "type": "none", "props": {} }
    }
  ]
}
```
