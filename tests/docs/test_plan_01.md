# Test Plan 01 Covered Cases

## Scope

- This document tracks only the cases that are already covered within the scope defined by `tmp/test_plan.md`.
- The counted coverage comes from:
  - `src/flow/tests/planner/**`
  - `src/flow/tests/pipeline/**`
  - selected processor unit tests that were explicitly added to validate runtime processor contracts discussed in the test plan
- This is a covered-cases inventory, not a gap analysis. Uncovered items and known defects are intentionally excluded here.
